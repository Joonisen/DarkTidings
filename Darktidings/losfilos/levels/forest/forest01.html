  <p>You slow down to catch your breath.<br>
    Looking behind you, there is no sign of, well, anything. Even though you have gone deep into the 
    <span style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px lightgreen">Forest of Doom</span> 
    you can't feel but relieved. Whatever you ran from, it certainly was more dangerous than the 
    <span style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px lightgreen">Forest of Doom</span>...<br><br>Right?</p>
  <p>Getting your bearings is easier said than done. Barely any sunlight penetrates the treetops, 
    providing little guidance on how to escape the forest. Going around in circles is the last thing you want to do.
    Well actually the last thing you want to do is turning back. 
    That would be foolish.<br><br>...Right?</p>

    To your left you see unnaturally thick foliage, no sense going there.
    Looking eastwards, the trees and foliage is thinner, passable.
